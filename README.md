**Print Queue Emulator – Java**

**Description:**  
This project is a print queue emulator developed in Java that simulates the behavior of a real print queue system. It utilizes various data structures, such as heaps, linked lists, hash tables, and montículos (priority queues), to manage and prioritize print jobs. The emulator allows users to add, remove, and manage jobs in the queue efficiently. Additionally, it features a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the system in a user-friendly way. The project highlights the use of advanced data structures and algorithms for optimizing print job management.

**Features:**
- Emulation of a print queue with job prioritization.
- Data structures used: heaps, linked lists, hash tables, and montículos.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction.
- Efficient job management and prioritization system.
  
**Technologies:**
- Java (OOP, data structures)
- GUI Framework (Swing/JavaFX, specify if applicable)
